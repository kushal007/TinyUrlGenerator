# TinyUrlGenerator
Welocme to URL shortener Service just like tinyURL, bit.ly or any other service from hundreds of github repo. But there is something new in this repo it's
made by me, it would be my first kinda-prod ready springboot application That I made from SRATCH. Am I proud of it yeah OFC I am. So go ahead and try running it on your local. 

Question 1: Do you know how to use DOCKER? No? Damn bro you are dumb, You call yourself a software dev? CHILL i didn't even know it before i created this app
It's easy stuff, like super easy. Don't be scared by the big word DOCKER. So this is what google says about it "Docker is an open source containerization platform. 
It enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment." 

Damn they sure know how to make anything sound so fancy. In simple words it's just a 'container' where you fill in all your dependency and then you just relax, meanwhile the dev is crying about how to resolve docker errors. 

Now you know what docker is, so go and install it in your computer.

Now the time has come for the application part: 

Step 1: Clone the repo (Wow so smart)

Step 2: cd TinyUrlGenerator

Step 3: docker-compose up 

and you are good to gooo.
